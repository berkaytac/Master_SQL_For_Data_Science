# Master-SQL-For-Data-Science

This repository contains the notes and codes I used in Imtiaz Ahmad's [Master SQL For Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-sql-for-data-science/) course on Udemy, and some useful materials.
I took this course to practice SQL.

Sql files called [sections](https://github.com/bernardo-lima/course-master-SLQ-for-data-science) and [topics](https://github.com/Andrew-Carl/Master-SQL-For-Data-Science) and cheat sheets are collected from external sources.
